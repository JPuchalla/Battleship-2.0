Iteration 1
Ship class
  An instance of this class will be a single ship on the board
  It will recieve 2 arguments upon initialization
    arg1 = name
    arg2 = length
  Attributes
    name
    length
    health
      health = length
  Methods
    sunk?
      true if health == 0
    hit
      needs to modify health attribute
        health - 1

Cell class
needs to require ship class
  An instance of this class will be a single cell on the board
  It will recieve 1 argument
    arg1 = Coordinate
  Attributes
    coordinate
    ship
      nil or ship object
    fired_upon = false
  Methods
    empty?
      if ship attribute is nil
        true
    place_ship(ship object)
      arg = ship object
      insert ship object into ship attribute
    fired_upon?
      checks if the cell has been fired upon
        return @fired_upon
    fire_upon
      will change @fire_upon to true
    render(ship = false)
      needs a default argument of false
      puts "S" if ship == true
      if @fired_upon == false
        puts "."
      elsif @fired_upon == true
        if @ship.nil?
          puts "M"
        elsif @ship != nil
          puts "H"
        end
      end
      Needs to be able to print "X" if the ship is sunk
        (If ship.health == 0)
